     * These endpoint(s) should be public non-pruned archive node
     * We recommend providing more than one endpoint for improved reliability, performance, and uptime
     * Public nodes may be rate limited, which can affect indexing speed
     * When developing your project we suggest getting a private API key
     * If you use a rate limited endpoint, adjust the --batch-size and --workers parameters
     * These settings can be found in your docker-compose.yaml, they will slow indexing but prevent your project being rate limited
